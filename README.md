# Neural Network for Character Classification

This repository contains an implementation of a simple feedforward neural network to classify characters based on images. The network is trained on a dataset of character images and can predict which character each image represents. The code is built using NumPy and handles image loading, processing, and classification tasks.

## Introduction
This project uses a feedforward neural network for character classification. It is designed to work on a dataset of grayscale images resized to 64x64 pixels. The neural network consists of one hidden layer and uses backpropagation to train the model. The goal is to predict the character based on image input.

## Model Architecture
- Input Layer: Each image is flattened to a vector of size 4096 (64x64).
- Hidden Layer: A fully connected layer with 100 hidden units.
- Output Layer: Softmax layer for multi-class classification.

The model also includes L2 regularization to prevent overfitting and gradient clipping during backpropagation.

## Dataset
The dataset should be organized in folders, with each folder representing a character. Images are loaded from these folders, resized, and converted to grayscale.

### Folder Structure:
```
/train
    /character_1
    /character_2
    ...
/test
    /character_1
    /character_2
    ...
```

- Training and test data should be in separate folders.
- Images should be in `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png` format.

## Training Process
- Cross-Entropy loss is used during training.
- The network is trained for a specified number of epochs with a learning rate of 0.001.
- After every 10 epochs, the current cross-entropy loss is printed.

## Evaluation
The model is evaluated using:
- Validation Accuracy: Calculated on a portion of the training data.
- Test Accuracy: Calculated on a separate test dataset.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/character-classification
   cd character-classification
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Required packages:
   - `numpy`
   - `Pillow`
   - `scikit-learn`

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset in the specified format.

2. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

   The model will automatically train and evaluate on the validation set. Once trained, it will output the test accuracy on your test dataset.

## Results
The model is trained on a dataset of images representing different characters and achieves a certain level of accuracy on both validation and test sets. The performance can be improved with further tuning of hyperparameters.
